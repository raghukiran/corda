/**
 * The [SendTransactionFlow] corresponds to the [ResolveTransactionsFlow].
 *
 * The [SendTransactionFlow] provides an ad hoc data vending service, which anticipates incoming data request from the
 * [otherSide] during the transaction resolving process.
 *
 * The number of request from [ResolveTransactionsFlow] is depends on the depth of the transaction history and the data
 * [otherSide] already possess, which is unpredictable. The [SendTransactionFlow] is expected to receive [FetchDataFlow.Request]
 * continuously until the [otherSide] has all the data they need to resolve the transaction, an [FetchDataFlow.EndRequest] will be
 * sent from the [otherSide] to indicate end of data request.
 *
 * @param otherSide the target party.
 * @param payload the message that will be sent to the [otherSide] before data vending starts.
