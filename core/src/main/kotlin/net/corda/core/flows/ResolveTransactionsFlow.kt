/**
 * The [ResolveTransactionsFlow] corresponds to the [SendTransactionFlow].
 *
 * This flow is used to verify the validity of a transaction by recursively checking the validity of all the
 * dependencies. Once a transaction is checked it's inserted into local storage so it can be relayed and won't be
 * checked again.
 *
 * A couple of constructors are provided that accept a single transaction. When these are used, the dependencies of that
 * transaction are resolved and then the transaction itself is verified. Again, if successful, the results are inserted
 * into the database as long as a [SignedTransaction] was provided. If only the [WireTransaction] form was provided
 * then this isn't enough to put into the local database, so only the dependencies are checked and inserted. This way
 * to use the flow is helpful when resolving and verifying a finished but partially signed transaction.
 *
 * The flow returns a list of verified [LedgerTransaction] objects, in a depth-first order.
