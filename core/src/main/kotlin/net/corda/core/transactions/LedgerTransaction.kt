/**
 * A LedgerTransaction is derived from a [WireTransaction]. It is the result of doing the following operations:
 *
 * - Downloading and locally storing all the dependencies of the transaction.
 * - Resolving the input states and loading them into memory.
 * - Doing some basic key lookups on the [Command]s to see if any keys are from a recognised party, thus converting the
 *   [Command] objects into [AuthenticatedObject].
 * - Deserialising the output states.
 *
 * All the above refer to inputs using a (txhash, output index) pair.

     * multiple dollar outputs, depending on things like how fragmented the owner's vault is and whether various privacy
     * techniques are in use. The quantity of dollars on the output side must sum to the same as on the input side, to
     * ensure no money is being lost track of. This summation and checking must be repeated independently for each
     * currency. To solve this, you would use groupStates with a type of Cash.State and a selector that returns the
     * currency field: the resulting list can then be iterated over to perform the per-currency calculation.
